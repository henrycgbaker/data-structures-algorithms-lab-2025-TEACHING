   "source": "---\n## Why Web Development in a Data Structures & Algorithms Course?\n\nYou might wonder why we're learning Flask in a DSA course. Here's the connection:\n\n1. **Practical Application**: Many algorithms you'll learn (sorting, searching, graph traversal) need interfaces. Building a simple web app lets you visualize and interact with your algorithms.\n\n2. **API Design**: Later labs will have you build REST APIs that expose algorithmic functionality. Understanding Flask routing is essential for this.\n\n3. **Data Flow**: Web apps demonstrate key CS concepts: request/response cycles, state management, and the client-server model.\n\n4. **Final Project Foundation**: Your course project may involve deploying an algorithm as a web service. This lab provides that foundation.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nBy completing this lab, you will be able to:\n1. Set up a Flask development environment with virtual environments\n2. Create routes that handle different URL patterns\n3. Pass data between Python backend and HTML templates\n4. Structure a multi-page application with template inheritance\n5. *(Foundation for future labs)* Understand how to expose Python functions via HTTP endpoints\n\n**Prerequisites:** This lab uses Python classes and objects (e.g., `Flask(__name__)`). If you need a refresher on OOP, see [Lab 2](lab_2_oop_classes.ipynb).",

Add this route to your app:\n\n```python\n@app.route(\"/fibonacci/<int:n>\")\ndef fibonacci_api(n):\n    \"\"\"Return the nth Fibonacci number as JSON.\"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return {\"error\": \"n must be non-negative\"}, 400\n    \n    # Simple iterative Fibonacci (O(n) time, O(1) space)\n    if n <= 1:\n        return {\"n\": n, \"fibonacci\": n}\n    \n    prev, curr = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(2, n + 1):\n        prev, curr = curr, prev + curr\n    \n    return {\"n\": n, \"fibonacci\": curr}\n```\n\nNow visit `http://localhost:5000/fibonacci/10` in your browser!\n\nThis demonstrates:\n- **URL parameters with type conversion** (`<int:n>`)\n- **Error handling** (returning 400 for invalid input)\n- **JSON responses** (Flask automatically converts dicts to JSON)\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Question:</b> What HTTP status code should we return for invalid input, and why?</summary>\n\n**Answer:** We return 400 (Bad Request) because the client provided invalid input (negative number). This follows REST conventions:\n- 200: Success\n- 400: Client error (bad input)\n- 404: Resource not found\n- 500: Server error\n\nProper status codes help API consumers handle errors programmatically.\n</details>\n\n---",

How could you update the `hello` function so that it does not raise a \"page not found\" error?\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Solution</b></summary>\n\nThe easiest (but not very scalable) way to do this is within your `.py` file:\n\n```python\n@app.route(\"/hello\")\n@app.route(\"/hello/<city>\")\ndef hello(city=None):\n    if city is None:\n        return \"<h1>Hello, there!</h1>\"\n    else:\n        return f\"<h1>Hello, {city}!</h1>\"\n```\n\n**Alternatively** (and this would be the more elegant and scalable way to do this) is to deal with the case of the city variable not being specified (aka being `None`) in a template. In this case, your `hello` function would look like this:\n\n```python\n@app.route(\"/hello\")\n@app.route(\"/hello/<city>\")\ndef hello(city=None):\n    return render_template('hello.html', city=city)\n```\n\nYou then also need to create a `hello.html` template within the `templates` folder, into which you write:\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Hello</title>\n    <meta name=\"description\" content=\"The page where you say hello.\">\n    <meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"some keywords\">\n</head>\n<body>\n{% if city %}\n    <h1>Hello, {{ city }}!</h1>\n{% else %}\n    <h1>Hello, there!</h1>\n{% endif %}\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n</details>"

   "source": "### Exercise 5: Navigation Bar with Template Inheritance\n\nThis exercise introduces **template inheritance**, a powerful Flask/Jinja2 feature for avoiding code duplication.\n\n#### Step 5.1: Understand the Problem\nCurrently, if you want a navigation bar on every page, you'd have to copy the HTML to each template. What if you have 10 pages? 100? Template inheritance solves this.\n\n#### Step 5.2: Create the Base Layout\n\nCreate `templates/layout.html`:\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>{% block title %}My App{% endblock %}</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <nav>\n        <a href=\"{{ url_for('home') }}\">Home</a>\n        <!-- TODO: Add more links -->\n    </nav>\n\n    <main>\n        {% block content %}\n        <!-- Child templates insert content here -->\n        {% endblock %}\n    </main>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Key concepts:**\n- `{% block name %}...{% endblock %}` defines replaceable sections\n- `{{ url_for('function_name') }}` generates URLs dynamically\n\n#### Step 5.3: Update home.html to Inherit\n\nModify `templates/home.html`:\n\n```html\n{% extends \"layout.html\" %}\n\n{% block title %}Home - My App{% endblock %}\n\n{% block content %}\n<h1>{{ heading }}</h1>\n<p>Welcome to the home page!</p>\n{% endblock %}\n```\n\n#### Step 5.4: Your Task\n\n1. Add an \"About\" link to the navigation in `layout.html`\n2. Update `about.html` to extend `layout.html`\n3. Add basic CSS styling to the nav (horizontal layout, hover effects)\n4. *(Bonus)* Add a \"Fibonacci Calculator\" page that uses the route from the preview section\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Hint: Making nav links horizontal with CSS</b></summary>\n\n```css\nnav {\n    background-color: #333;\n    padding: 10px;\n}\nnav a {\n    color: white;\n    text-decoration: none;\n    margin-right: 15px;\n}\nnav a:hover {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n}\n```\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Full Solution</b></summary>\n\n**layout.html:**\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>{% block title %}My App{% endblock %}</title>\n    <style>\n        nav { background-color: #333; padding: 10px; }\n        nav a { color: white; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 15px; }\n        nav a:hover { text-decoration: underline; }\n        main { padding: 20px; }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <nav>\n        <a href=\"{{ url_for('home') }}\">Home</a>\n        <a href=\"{{ url_for('about') }}\">About</a>\n    </nav>\n    <main>\n        {% block content %}{% endblock %}\n    </main>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**about.html:**\n```html\n{% extends \"layout.html\" %}\n\n{% block title %}About - My App{% endblock %}\n\n{% block content %}\n<h1>About Page</h1>\n<p>This is the about page.</p>\n{% endblock %}\n```\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Comprehension Check:</b> What's the advantage of template inheritance over copy-pasting?</summary>\n\n**Answer:** Template inheritance follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle:\n1. **Single source of truth** - Change the nav once, it updates everywhere\n2. **Consistency** - All pages automatically share the same structure\n3. **Maintainability** - Fixing a bug in the layout fixes it for all pages\n4. **Scalability** - Adding 100 pages doesn't mean copying 100 nav bars\n</details>"
